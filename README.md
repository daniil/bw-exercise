## Requirements

Create a page with a table and a form with the following fields:

-          First name (required)
-          Last name (required)
-          Grade (required, numeric)
-          Comment (optional)

Bootstrap the table with Johnny, Appleseed, 50, *blank*

**Initial features**

1.       Rows can be deleted
2.       Any field of any row can be edited in place
3.       Table maintains a sort by Grade, First, Last (in that order)
4.       Use anything you want for JS implementation
5.       Leaving design / UX up to you
  -       Design/CSS should be minimum to look decent
  -      50-100 lines of CSS is fine, no need to go nuts there
  -       Avoid CSS frameworks (but something like normalize.css is OK)

**Additional feature request**

Create undo functionality which would work for edits, deletes and adds

## Running

Run simple http server (NodeJS `http-server` package or Python's `SimpleHTTPServer`) in a `client` folder.
